## The Logo

Tool used to convert the logo from `.ai` to `.svg` was just <https://cloudconvert.com>.

Then to make the optimized version, <https://svgomg.net/> with

1. Precision at 0
2. Multipass
3. Style to attributes
4. Prefer viewBox to width/height

Finally, to make sure the website can tint the logo, I changed the color to `currentColor`.
